# Story Weaver AI

An instruction-following AI that transforms a user's creative vision—genre, setting, character, plot, and tone—into a complete, original short story.

## 🚀 Project Status

**In Progress:** Phase 0 and Phase 1 are complete. Now moving on to model fine-tuning.

## About The Project

The Story Weaver AI is an instruction-following narrative generator. Its core purpose is to empower user creativity by transforming a structured set of creative ideas into a fully-formed, coherent short story. The user acts as the "director," providing the high-level vision, and the AI acts as the "obedient author," executing that vision with creative flair.

The project is built by fine-tuning a `gpt2-medium` model on a custom, synthetically generated dataset.



## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **AI Development:** `Python`, `PyTorch`, `Hugging Face (transformers, datasets)`, `GPT-2`, `Google Gemini API`
* **Web Application:** `FastAPI`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
* **Version Control:** `Git`, `GitHub`, `Git LFS`

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

This project is being executed in five distinct phases.

* **✅ Phase 0: Environment Setup & Preparation**
    * **Status:** Complete
    * **Summary:** Set up the local Python environment, created the GitHub repository, and established a secure connection to the Google Gemini API for data generation.

* **✅ Phase 1: Synthetic Dataset Generation**
    * **Status:** Complete
    * **Summary:** Developed scripts to programmatically generate 5,000+ unique creative prompts and use a "Ghostwriter" LLM to generate corresponding stories. The final dataset has been created and is tracked using Git LFS.

* **➡️ Phase 2: Model Fine-Tuning (Next Up)**
    * **Objective:** To teach the GPT-2 model the specific skill of being an "Obedient Author." This involves writing and running the training script on a GPU using our custom dataset.

* **➡️ Phase 3: Application Interface & Deployment**
    * **Objective:** Create a web application for users to interact with the model. This includes building a FastAPI backend and a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

* **➡️ Phase 4: Evaluation & Refinement**
    * **Objective:** Test the model's performance by providing a diverse range of prompts and analyzing its ability to follow instructions, maintain coherence, and adhere to the specified tone.
